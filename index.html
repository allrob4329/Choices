    <p> I am focusing on completing highschool with a A and B to be able to attend a good college to go to a career that I want to go to. I am majoring in computer technology, and become a computer completer, I'm taking Game design, Web design, and Computer Programming 1 and 2. I started looking at careers or jobs that involve Game design and/or Computwer Programming, I didn't expect the average Starting salary for these jobs were almost $85,000 to almost $90,000. But to be able to get these careers I need a degree (Game Design needs a highschool diploma, Computer programmers need at least a bachelors degree, But I still want a assosiates degree) the colleges I want to go to that can have a computer programming/game design that is in my state are College of charleston, Trident Tech, and Clemson University. I first need to go to trident tech to take a 2 years for a bachelors degree, then go to either of the other college to get a Assosiates degree, I will need to keep my GPA up to the 3.80 to attend the colleg of Charleston or try to go for at least a 3.90 to attend the clemson.</p>
    <p> For a Computer Programming career I looked into a company called Revature they give a minimum average of $55,000/yr, however the benifits are having a 401k, life, health, and dental insurance, and mentoring which is nice to have if I needed help. I started to look at other game design careers I didn't thought about trying out for an actually well known video game companys, so I looked at job applications for Blizzard, EA, Rockstar Games for game design, and ActionNet Inc. and Medical career Institute for computer programming. I was amaze on Blizzards starting salary of $60,015-$134,061. I am learning about computers coding on java and  good at making the program work properly. The only problem is my ADHD I sometimes rush my work get easily distracted and don't focus on my work, I luckily have medication  a take 1 a day to help me focuson my work. I don't know if I want to retire if my father does not want to retire and keep on working then I should too.</p>
    <p> I do want to live some where either close to my parent's home or somewhere with a dock so I can fish with my dad. I will save up to drive a jeep or a motorcycle to drive to work with. I have not explore any area that I want to live oir retire to. I need to be ready an interview for a job, I need get dress in a nice suit and be ready to go to work, have a positive attitude and have a firm handshake. All of this will cost me around $401,157 this is for a 2 year college tuition is $4,248 fot a years tuition, a monthly average for a jeep wrangler which is $565 per month, and most of the cost is for a house in the charleston district which is around $374,450.</p>
